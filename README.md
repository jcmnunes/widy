# Widy - What I did yesterday

[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/jcmnunes/widy/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/jcmnunes/widy/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

This is the main repo of the Widy app. It is a React SPA on the frontend with a Node/Express/MongoDB backend.

> ðŸš¨ Note: This app is actually my personal **breakable toy** ðŸ§«ðŸ§ª Also, the app is hosted on a free Heroku dyno and therefore may go to sleep during periods of inactivity

1. Helps you organize your daily tasks.
2. Helps you track your daily work.
3. Generates handy reports.
